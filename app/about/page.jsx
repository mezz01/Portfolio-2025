                <p>Started my journey in 1337'42school' after succeeding in the piscine of 2021 which was a set of C and linux commands exams and exercises for a whole month.
                    I learned all valuable things in my journey at 1337KH, from low level programming in C and using different algorithms and Data structures, to Git and linux command lines.
                    But more importantly team work and peerLearning, using only projects and google as our friends 'which were like family there'.
